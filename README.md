Using Wide Residual Networks to get state-of-the-art results in CIFAR-10 dataset

Do not put too much attention on file names, I have been experimenting with different settings, so file names do not make sense.

KaggleV2.0.3.1 - WRN-16-2-SGD_fix.ipynb - is a WRN-16-2 architecture. wide_residual_network_fix_v2.py is used to build the architecture.
KaggleV2.2 - WRN-28-10.ipynb - is a WRN-28-10 architecture. wide_residual_network_fix_v3.py is used to build the architecture.

wide_residual_network_fix_v2.py and wide_residual_network_fix_v3.py are quite similar and should produce similar results (I tried on some epochs).

WRN-16-2.png and WRN-28-10.png are visualized models of the those architectures.
